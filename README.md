**Arch Linux and Hyprladn configuration files**

This will increase over time, as chaos do. These are not, however, my current configuration files, as I'm in the process of automating EVERY aspect of a brand new Arch Linux/Hyprland installation tailored to my sepcific needs. That is a work in progress and it will have its own repository soon enough.
